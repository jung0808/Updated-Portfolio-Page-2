This is my last portfolio page assignment for me in this bootcamp.

In this homework, I still used HTML & CSS & Javascript, and everything I learned through this bootcamp to make my Portfolio page.

We are still working on our final projects page, and will update that portion with the correct screenshot and description, along with any feedback I receive from this homework.

I will also be adding testimonials sections after bootcamp is over.

Thank you for reading! You can find my live porfolio in the link below. ðŸ˜Š
